# iss_overhead
Makes an api call to the api named Open Notify.
The program simply gets the current position of the ISS using the api and compares it with the user's location. If the difference between their locations is -5 degrees or +5 degrees,
if it is so, the user can see the ISS but obviously if it is night and her position. 
If the user can see the ISS we just need to send her an email at the provided id and say 'Look Up!".
